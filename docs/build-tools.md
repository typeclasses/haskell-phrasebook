## Tools to use while editing

### Haskell language server

If you are using Visual Studio Code, we recommend installing the [Haskell](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell) extension. Error messages and other helpful annotations will then appear in the editor.

### ghcid

If you are not using an editor with integrated language support, [ghcid](https://typeclasses.com/ghci/ghcid) is a good alternative.

```sh
$ ghcid --command 'cabal repl hello-world'
```

## Experimentation and testing

### Running a program

There are two ways to run one of the example programs:

  1. Run it directly using `runhaskell`. For example, `runhaskell hello-world.hs`. The program's dependencies must already be installed. See information about Nix below to make that easier.
  2. Run using cabal. For example, `cabal run hello-world`.

### The REPL

To open a REPL, use the "cabal repl" command, giving as an argument the name of the program you want to load.

```sh
$ cabal repl hello-world

Î»> main
hello world
```

### The test suites

To run the tests:

```sh
$ cabal test all
```

The tests are also run automatically by [GitHub actions](https://github.com/typeclasses/haskell-phrasebook/actions).

## Nix

You do not have to use Nix to run these Haskell programs, but you may find it convenient. Within the Nix shell, you have all of the dependencies required by the examples in the Phrasebook. For example, you can run commands like `runhaskell` and `ghcid`.

```sh
$ nix-shell

[nix-shell]$ ghc --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 9.0.1
```

### Getting started with Nix

[Install Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#chap-installation).

Optionally, install [Cachix](https://cachix.org/) and add the `typeclasses` cache. This step is optional, but will greatly reduce build time.

```sh
$ nix-env -iA 'cachix' -f 'https://cachix.org/api/v1/install'
$ cachix use 'typeclasses'
```

### Nix dependency versions

All of the Nix tools are configured to use a specific version of [the Nix package set](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/) to ensure that the code works the same in all environments. This version is specified in `tools/versions.json`.

You can run `./tools/update-versions` to update the dependency hashes in `tools/versions.json` to their latest commits. The JSON data is then used by `tools/versions.nix`. This system is described in Vaibhav Sagar's blog post, [*Quick and Easy Nixpkgs Pinning*](https://vaibhavsagar.com/blog/2018/05/27/quick-easy-nixpkgs-pinning/).
