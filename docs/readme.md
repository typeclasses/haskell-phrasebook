# The Haskell Phrasebook

*The Haskell Phrasebook* is a free quick-start Haskell guide comprised of a sequence of small annotated programs. It provides a cursory overview of selected Haskell features, jumping-off points for further reading, and recommendations to help get you writing programs as soon as possible.

This repository contains only the code files; you may find them useful if you want to follow along while reading the *Phrasebook*, which can be found at [typeclasses.com/phrasebook](https://typeclasses.com/phrasebook).

**Contributing** -- We love to hear any requests or ideas for how to expand or improve the Phrasebook! Please see the [contributor guide](https://typeclasses.github.io/haskell-phrasebook/contributing).

**Build tools** -- See the [build tools](https://typeclasses.github.io/haskell-phrasebook/build-tools) page for information on how to build and run the Phrasebook examples.
